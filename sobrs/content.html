<div>
<p>All companies must choose a company name as part of the company registration process.</p>
<p>If you&apos;ve reserved your company name already with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC), choose the &apos;Use a reserved name&apos; option.</p>
<h4>What is a company name?</h4>
<p>A company name is a company&apos;s legal name. This is the name that appears on all official documents and legal papers, such as legal contracts and registrations and property leases.</p>

<p>A company name has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first part is a name that you choose (we&apos;ll check that it&apos;s available to register).</li>
<li>The second part identifies the company type (such as proprietary limited).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><hr />For example: Fishing Supplies Proprietary Limited<hr /></blockquote>

<p>If you don&apos;t want to choose a name, you can use the company&apos;s Australian Company Number (ACN) as the first part of your company name. An ACN is a unique 9 digit number that&apos;s issued to your company when it&apos;s registered. On company registration certificates and the company register, names that use the ACN will display with &apos;A.C.N.&apos; at the front.</p>

<blockquote><hr />For example, A.C.N. 123 456 789 Proprietary Limited<hr /></blockquote>

<h4>Do I also need to register a business name?</h4>
<p>If you want to run a business under a name that&apos;s different to the company name, you&apos;ll need to register that name as a business name.</p>


<blockquote><hr /> <p>For example: Jane registers a company with the company name &apos;Farming Partners Pty Ltd&apos;.</p><p>If Jane trades under this exact name (she advertises her company using this name, uses it for her shop signage, etc) then she <strong>doesn&apos;t</strong> need to register a business name.</p> 
<p>If she wants to trade under:</p>
<ul>
<li>the name &apos;Fresh Food&apos;, she <strong>must register</strong> &apos;Fresh Food&apos; as a <strong>business name</strong></li>
<li>&apos;Farming Partners&apos; (without the Pty Ltd), she <strong>must register</strong> &apos;Farming Partners&apos; as a <strong>business name</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</blockquote>

</div></div><h2>Content key: CompanyNameUseACN</h2><p>Help content:</p><div><h3>Use ACN</h3>
<div>
<p>If you don&apos;t want to create a name, you can simply use your Australian Company Number (ACN) as the company name.</p>

<p>An ACN is a unique 9 digit number that&apos;s issued to your company when it&apos;s successfully registered. You still need to include a legal element to identify the company type. On company registration certificates and the company register, names that use the ACN will display with &apos;A.C.N.&apos; at the front.</p>

<blockquote><hr />For example, A.C.N. 123 456 789 Proprietary Limited.<hr /></blockquote>

<p>Answer <strong>No</strong> to this question if you&apos;re applying for an ABN for a non-regulated superannuation fund that is not intending to be regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) or the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p> 
<p>A non-regulated superannuation fund needs to be exempt under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993(ADD LINK). Examples of non-regulated super funds include:</p>

<div>
<p>Incorporated associations are usually clubs or community groups that have decided to give their organisation a formal legal structure.</p>
<p>Incorporated associations usually have at least five members. They must use all profits to achieve the association&apos;s aims.</p>
<p>When a club or group incorporates, it becomes a separate legal entity (separate from its members). It can do things in its own name, such as lease a property or be sued. This protects the members from any legal liability.</p>
<p>Associations are incorporated under state or territory legislation. They can only operate in that state or territory.</p>
<blockquote><hr />To operate outside its state or territory of incorporation, an incorporated association must <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/registering-a-company/steps-to-register-a-company/registrable-australian-bodies/">register with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC)</a> under the <em>Corporations Act 2001</em>.<hr /></blockquote>

<p>A DGR is entitled to receive income tax deductible gifts and tax deductible contributions.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><strong>Please note:</strong> A DGR does not automatically receive tax concessions. This requires a separate endorsement by the ATO.</p><hr /></blockquote>
<p>There are two types of DGR endorsement: </p>
<ul>

  <li>where an entity is endorsed for the operation of a fund, authority or institution that it owns or includes, for example, school building funds or council libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the second type, only gifts to the fund, authority or institution are tax deductible. </p>
<p>Not all DGR&apos;s are registered charities that are exempt from income tax. Find out why on <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Non-profit/Gifts-and-fundraising/Tax-and-fundraising/">fundraising and income tax</a>page.</p>

<div>
<p>A public company must have rules for how it will be governed or managed. For example, rules for how directors will be appointed and how shareholder meetings will be organised.</p>
<p>Most companies can be governed by a constitution, replaceable rules, or a combination of both.</p>

<h4>Replaceable rules</h4>
<p>Replaceable rules are a basic set of rules for managing a company. They are set out in the <em>Corporations Act 2001</em>.</p>

<p>Using replaceable rules means you don?t need to worry about having or maintaining your own written constitution (or dealing with the expense of keeping the constitution up to date with the law).</p>

<p>These rules are called &apos;replaceable&apos; rules because you can replace all or some of the rules with a constitution.</p>


<p>Read an outline of the <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/starting-a-company/constitution-and-replaceable-rules/replaceable-rules-outlined/">replaceable rules</a> on the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) website.</p>

<h4>Constitution</h4>

<p>A company can use its own constitution instead of the replaceable rules, or use a constitution to replace some of the replaceable rules.</p>
<p>If the company has more than one shareholder (member), they must all agree to the terms and conditions of a constitution before the company can adopt it.</p>

<blockquote><hr />If your company will be governed by a constitution (either fully or partly), you&apos;ll need to upload a copy in the next step of the form.<hr /></blockquote>

<div><p>An ABN is a unique 11 digit number that identifies your business to the public, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and other government agencies.</p>
<p>Applying for an ABN is free, but not everyone is entitled to one.</p>
<h4>Why should I have an ABN? </h4>
<p>If you&apos;re running a business, you may need an ABN. Having an ABN means you can:</p>
<ul><li>confirm your business identity to others when ordering and invoicing</li>
<li>avoid having business clients withhold a percentage of any payments they make to you </li>
<li>register a business name </li>
<li>register a &apos;.com.au&apos;, &apos;.net.au&apos;, or &apos;.org.au&apos; domain name.</li></ul>
<p>You also need to have an ABN if you register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) </p>

<blockquote><hr /><p>You <strong>don&apos;t</strong> need an ABN if the business is:</p>
<ul>
<li>located in the Christmas or Cocos Islands</li>
<li>a joint venture (where the partners have their own ABNs).</li>
</ul>
<hr /></blockquote>
<h4>Do I also need a business TFN? </h4>
<p>If you&apos;re applying for an ABN for a partnership, company or trust, you&apos;ll need a business TFN.</p> 
<p>The good news is you <strong>don&apos;t need to register</strong>. The ATO will automatically issue the partnership, company or trust with a TFN (if one doesn&apos;t already exist).</p>
<h4>Can I use my old ABN?</h4>
<p>You can reuse a previous ABN if the old business had the same entity type as the new one. </p>
<blockquote> <hr /> <strong>Please note:</strong> If the entity types are different, you?ll be issued with a new ABN.<hr /></blockquote>
<p>To reuse a previous ABN, first apply for a new ABN here on the Business registration service. Once this application is successful, the Australian Business Registrar can then issue you with your old ABN.  </p>

<p>A business name, also known as a trading name, is a name or title under which a person, or other legal entity, carries on business. It also helps customers and other businesses find, identify and connect with your business. </p>
<p>You need to register a business name if you conduct business under a name other than your own.</p>

<h4>Protecting your business name </h4>

<h4>What is a Public Beta website?</h4>
<p>A public beta website is typically a real working website or service in its final testing stage. A beta is used to receive public feedback to help improve the service.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><strong>Please note:</strong> Even though the Business Registration Service is in beta, the registrations you apply for are <strong>real</strong>!<hr /></blockquote> 
<p>So if you use the Business Registration Service, please <a href="https://www.business.gov.au/Forms/Feedback">give us your feedback</a>.</p>
<h4>What does it cost to register?</h4>
<p>There is no charge to register for tax registrations, but there is a fee for the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Business name</strong> - For each business name, you can pay $35 for 1 year or $82 for 3 years. See the current <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/payments-fees-and-invoices/asic-fees/schedules-of-business-names-fees">list of business name fees</a> on the ASIC website.</li>
<li><strong>Australian company</strong> - The cost depends on the type of company you register. For example you&apos;ll pay $479 to register a proprietary limited company. See the current <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/payments-fees-and-invoices/asic-fees/schedules-of-corporations-fees/">list of company fees</a> on the ASIC website.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where can I register for a business TFN?</h4>
<p>If you&apos;re applying for an ABN for a partnership, company or trust you&apos;ll need a business TFN.</p>
<p>The good news is you <strong>don&apos;t need to register</strong>. The ATO will automatically issue a partnership, company or trust with a TFN (if one doesn&apos;t already exist).</p>
<h4>Can I register Norfolk Island businesses here?</h4>
<p>Yes. Norfolk Island businesses can apply here for the following business registrations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Australian Business Number (ABN)</li>
<li>Business name</li>
<li>Australian company ? if operating on the Australian mainland</li>
<li>Pay As You Go (PAYG) withholding</li>
<li>Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT)</li>
<li>AUSKey</li>
</ul>
<p>Norfolk Island businesses do not need to register for Goods and Services Tax (GST), Luxury Car Tax (LCT), Fuel Tax Credits (FTC) or Wine Equalisation Tax (WET).</p>
<blockquote><hr />
<p><strong>Norfolk Island companies</strong> are registered with the <a href="http://www.norfolkisland.gov.nf/services/registry-lands-companies-births-deaths-and-marriages">Norfolk Island Registry</a>.</p>

<p>However, if your Norfolk Island company is or will be operating on the Australian mainland, you&apos;ll need to register as a foreign company with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC).</p>

<p>Not at the moment.

<p>A holding company can in turn be held by another company, and so on. The <strong>ultimate holding company</strong> is the company at the top of the chain of ownership. It doesn?t have another company holding it.</p>
<blockquote><hr />
<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you&apos;re not sure whether your company will have an ultimate holding company, consider seeking independent legal advice.</p>

<div>
<h4>Business name format</h4>
<p>When you enter your business name, it will automatically be converted to <strong>uppercase letters</strong>. The system will also accept the following:</p>
<ul><li>spaces</li>
<li>letters A to Z</li>
<li>numbers 0 to 9</li>
<li>standard punctuation marks such as .  , &#63;  &#33;  &#40;  &#41;  &#123;  &#125;  &#58;  &#59;  ?  ?  ? </li>
<li>the symbols  &#124;  -   _  \   / &#64;  &#35;  &#36;  &#37;  &#42;   &#61;  &amp;</li></ul>
<p>The form <strong>will not</strong> accept letters with an accent such as &#224;, &#233;, &#265; or &#231;.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><strong>Example:</strong> Lisa wants to register &apos;Lisa&apos;s Caf&#233;&apos;. <br /><br />Although her name will need to be registered as &apos;LISA&apos;S CAFE&apos;, she can still use &apos;Lisa&apos;s Caf&#233;&apos; on her marketing, signage and receipts.<hr /></blockquote> 
<h4>Display your name</h4>
<p>You are no longer required to display your business name registration certificate. However, <strong>legally you must</strong> display your business name on each:</p>
<ul><li>location where you&apos;re trading to the public, such as shops or stalls at an exhibition</li>
<li>official documents, such as quotes, tax invoices and receipts.</li></ul>

<h4>Protect your name</h4>
<p>Not all names are available to register. Names that are identical to a name registered by someone else, contain restricted or undesirable words or expressions can&apos;t be registered. Some names may also require manual processing. Check the <a href="http://asic.gov.au/bn-availability">business naming rules</a> on the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) website to see what can and can&apos;t be registered.</p>

<p>Even if your proposed name meets the business naming rules, the same name could still be registered by someone else as a trade mark or domain name. Before you register your name, consider these steps:</p>

<ul><li>Make sure you&apos;re not infringing on someone else&apos;s intellectual property (IP). Visit the IP Australia website for information on <a href="https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks">searching for trade marks</a> in Australia and overseas for your proposed business name.</li>
<li>If you want to use your proposed business name as part of your web address, read our <a href="https://www.business.gov.au/Info/Run/Advertising-and-online/Register-a-website-name">register a website name</a> page.</li>
<li>Apply for a trade mark. Registering a business name doesn&apos;t stop others from using it for a different purpose. For example, even if you&apos;ve registered a business name, others could still use the same name for their products. To protect your business name, <a href="https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks">apply for a trade mark</a> on the IP Australia website.</li></ul>

<h4>Multiple names</h4>
<p>You can register multiple business names. For example, if you run three businesses, you can register a different business name for each of them. </p>
<h4>Renew a business name</h4>
<p>The Business registration service does not currently process business name renewals. See the different options available for <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/renewing-and-maintaining-your-business-name/renew-your-business-name/">renewing your business name</a> on the ASIC website.</p>

<h4>How GST works</h4>
<p>GST is a tax of 10&#37; on most goods and services sold in Australia. Generally, businesses that are registered for GST&#58;</p>
<ul><li>collect GST on the goods and services they sell and forward it to the ATO</li>
<li>claim credits for the GST included in the price of goods and services they buy for their business.</li></ul>
<h4>What do I need to do&#63;</h4> 
<p>If you&apos;re registered for GST, you&apos;ll need to: </p>
<ul><li>work out which goods and services you sell are subject to GST</li> 
<li>include GST in the prices you charge for those goods and services </li>
<li>give tax invoices to your customers that include the GST amount </li>
<li>account for GST in your books </li>
<li>put aside the GST you&#39;ve collected</li> 
<li>get tax invoices and claim GST credits for goods and services you buy for your own business</li> 
<li>lodge activity statements or annual returns to the ATO</li>  
<li>pay GST to the ATO &#40;or get a GST refund&#41;.</li></ul>

<div>
<p>Select the share class that the shareholder has agreed in writing to take up.</p>
<h4>What is a share class?</h4>
<p>A company can use different classes of shares to give shareholders different rights (such as different voting powers or different dividend rates). </p> 
<p>To keep it simple, most companies make all their shares <strong>ordinary shares</strong>. The ordinary share class is the most commonly used share class. Ordinary shares give shareholders normal voting and dividend rights.</p>

<blockquote><hr /><p><strong>Important! </strong> If you?re not sure what share class to use, consider getting advice from a business adviser or other professional. </p><hr /></blockquote>

<h4>Other standard share classes</h4>
<p>Other standard share classes include: </p>
<ul>
<li>A to F class shares - these shares usually give dividends at different rates compared to ordinary shareholders</li>
<li>preference shares - these shares usually give holders preference in some things, such as priority payment of dividends over other share classes</li>
<li>redeemable shares - depending on their terms of issue, these shares can usually be redeemed at the decision of the company, the shareholder, after a fixed time, or on a specific date. </li>
</ul>

<p>While these share classes are standard, each company can decide on the rights and restrictions attached to them. For example, two companies may issue class A shares, but the rights attached to these shares can be completely different.</p>

<h4>Custom share class</h4>
<p>If the company uses a custom share class, you must provide the following details: </p>
<ul>
<li>Class code - made up of 1 to 4 letters. </li>
<li>Class description - a short phrase that describes the share class. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote><hr /><p>For example, a family-held company has created a special class of shares for family members, which gives an extra dividend based on their contribution to the company. The custom share class code is <strong>FAM</strong> and the class description is <strong>family special dividend</strong>. </p><hr /></blockquote>

<div>
<p> Once you register a company, it can operate in any state or territory. Company registration is a <strong>national</strong> registration.</p>
<p>However, you still need to choose the state or territory the company is &apos;taken to be registered in&apos;. Most companies choose the state or territory in which they will operate their company.</p>
<p>The company will need to meet any laws of that state or territory that apply to it. For example, stamp duty rates vary between the states and territories.</p>
<div><hr />The state or territory will appear on the certificate of company registration.
<hr /></div>
<p>You can apply to change the state or territory of registration later, but there is a fee to do this.

The partnership can employ staff, but the partners in the partnership are not considered employees.</p><p>Help content:</p><div><h3>Partnerships</h3>
<div>
    <p>A partnership structure is relatively inexpensive and easy to set up and operate.</p>
    <p>In a partnership structure, <strong>you and your business partners own the business together</strong> and share the income and losses of the business. A partnership can have two or more partners.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p>You&apos;re in a <em>family</em> partnership structure if two or more of the partners are related.</p><hr /></blockquote>
    <p>Each partner reports their share of the income on their own individual tax return, and pays tax at their <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/individual-income-tax-rates/" target="_blank">individual income tax rate</a>. The partnership must lodge a <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/business/reports-and-returns/income-tax-return/#Partnershipsandpartners" target="_blank">partnership income tax return</a> every year with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><strong>Tax File Number (TFN):</strong> A partnership needs its own TFN. The good news is you <strong>don&apos;t need to register</strong>. The ATO will automatically issue a partnership with a TFN (if one doesn&apos;t already exist).</p><hr /></blockquote>
    <p>All partners share legal responsibility for the business. This means the personal assets of all partners are at risk if things go wrong. If some partners want to limit their responsibility for business losses, you might want to consider a limited partnership structure. See below for more information.</p>
    <p>If your business employs staff, all partners are responsible for giving staff their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p>
<blockquote><hr />
    <h4>Example of a partnership</h4>
    <p>Greg and Fiona operate their website business as a partnership. The partnership has its own tax file number (TFN).</p>
    <p>A partnership is not a separate legal entity and doesn&apos;t pay income tax on the income it earns. Instead, Greg and Fiona pay tax on their share of the net partnership income they each receive.</p>
    <p>While the partnership doesn&apos;t pay tax, it does have to lodge an annual partnership tax return to show all income the partnership earned and deductions it claimed for expenses it incurred in carrying on the partnership business. The tax return also shows each partner&apos;s share of the net partnership income.</p>

    </ul>
    <h4>Limited partnerships</h4>
    <p>In a limited partnership, there are two types of partners: a general partner and a limited partner. There must be at least one of each.</p>
    <p>General partners are responsible for the day-to-day management of the business and their responsibility for losses (their liability for debt) is unlimited. Limited partners don&apos;t play any role in the day-to-day management of the business, and their liability for debt is limited to the amount they contributed to the partnership.</p>
    <p>You <strong>must</strong> register a limited partnership in your state or territory. Contact your <a href="http://www.australia.gov.au/about-government/states-territories-and-local-government" target="_blank">state or territory government</a> to find out more.</p>
</div></div><h2>Content key: HelpMeDecideBusinessStructureCompany</h2><p>Inline content: A company is a separate legal entity from you, and has at least one shareholder (owner) and one director (who runs the business). Income and losses belong to the company. Companies can employ staff.</p><p>Help content:</p><div><h3>Companies</h3>
<div>
    <p>A company structure has higher costs and is more difficult to set up. Running a company can also be more expensive, because you have to meet reporting and other requirements under Australian company law. This is why the structure is generally considered to be better suited to medium to large businesses.</p>
    <p>A company structure means that your business is a <strong>separate legal entity from you</strong>. This means the company has the same rights as a natural person and can have debt, sue and be sued. A company is owned by its shareholders and run by its directors.</p>
    <p>The personal assets of directors and shareholders are separate from the company, so they can&apos;t be used to pay company debts. In certain cases where directors breach their duties, they may be held personally responsible for company losses.</p>
    <p>The income and losses that the business makes belongs to the company, and is reported on a company tax return. The <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Small-business-entity-concessions/Concessions/Income-tax-concessions/Small-business-company-tax-rate/">company tax rate</a> applies to the business income.</p>

    <p>If the company employs staff, the company is responsible for giving them their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p>

    <p>Companies must appoint a <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/tax-professionals/your-practice/tax-and-bas-agents/primary-contact-and-authorised-contacts/#Public_officer">public officer</a> and let the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) know. Public officers are responsible for making sure the company complies with tax law, keeping tax records and submitting company tax returns. The ATO needs to know their details so they can contact them about company tax matters.</p><hr /></blockquote>
    <h4>Proprietary limited company</h4>
<p>Companies can be proprietary (private) or public. Most companies in Australia are proprietary limited. A proprietary limited company generally isn&apos;t allowed to raise money from the public by selling shares (like public companies can).</p>
    <p>They must have:</p>
    <ul>
<li>no more than 50 non-employee shareholders</li>
        <li>at least one shareholder (also known as a member)</li>
        <li>at least one director.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can be both a shareholder and a director. You can also be the sole shareholder and director.</p>

    <p>When companies are &apos;limited&apos;, the liability of shareholders is limited to any unpaid value (if any) on their shares. This means that shareholders can only be responsible for company losses <strong>up to</strong> any amount unpaid on their shares.</p>

<hr /></blockquote>

 <h4>Public companies</h4>

<h4>Protecting your business name</h4>
    <p>It&apos;s important to know that registering your business name does <strong>not</strong> give you exclusive rights to it! Other businesses won&apos;t be able to register your name, but they can still use it to name a product or service.</p>
<p>If you trade mark your business name, it will be protected in all Australian states and territories for an initial period of 10 years. 
You can <a href="https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/applying-for-a-trade-mark/how-to-apply-for-a-trade-mark" target="_blank">apply for a trade mark</a> on the IP Australia website.</p>

<h4>Websites and business names</h4>
<p>Website addresses are called domain names, for example, sarahsflowers.com.au or josephsmitharchitects.com.au.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re keen to have domain name that reflects your business name, it&apos;s a good idea to register a domain name, even if you&apos;re not quite ready to set up your website. 
Generally prices range from $10 to $100 AUD for a year&apos;s registration. </p>

<div><h4>Where to now?</h4>
<p>There are a number of registrations you may still need before you can start trading. State and territories have various licences and permits that are often required prior to starting your business or company.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://ablis.business.gov.au/">Australian Business Licence and Information Service (ABLIS)</a> to find the licences and permits you need to run your business.</p>
<h4>How do I change my form details?</h4>
<p>If you?ve made a mistake in your company or business name, you must <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/contact-us/">notify ASIC</a> within 24 hours after the registration. Generally if there?s a typing error (e.g. letters are mixed up or missing), ASIC will correct it.</p>
<p>If your details have changed, you have 28 days from when you were aware of the change to:
<ul><li><a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Registration/Update-your-details/">update your tax registration details</a></li>

<p>There are penalties if the information entered is false or misleading.

<h4>Family and other partnerships</h4>
<p>There is no legal paperwork required to form a family or other partnership. However, there are legal responsibilities that come with being a partner.</p>
<p>Each partner must report their share of the income on their own individual tax return, and pay tax at their <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/individual-income-tax-rates/">individual income tax rate</a>. </p>
<p>The partnership must also lodge a partnership <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/business/reports-and-returns/income-tax-return/" target="_blank">income tax return</a> every year with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>
<p>All partners share legal responsibility and any debt equally. </p>
 <p>If your business employs staff, all partners are responsible for giving staff their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p>

<h4>Limited partnerships</h4>
<p>Partners in a limited partnership must register the partnership and comply with their relevant state or territory partnership legislation. This legislation is administered by the <a href="https://www.business.gov.au/info/run/fair-trading/fair-trading-laws">Consumer affairs or Fair trading office</a> in each state and territory.</p>
<p>A limited partnership is considered a company for tax purposes and the partnership must lodge a company tax return with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>
<p>Not all partners share legal responsibility for the business. The limited partners only share responsibility and debt according to the limitations set out in the state or territory registration. </p>

<p>To be entitled to an Australian Business Number (ABN), a deceased estate must:</p>
<ul><li>be carrying on a business or businesslike activity of a deceased person for the purposes of getting the affairs in order.</li>
<li>have a trustee (e.g. an executor named in a will or administrator appointed by a court).</li></ul>
<p>An executor finalising a deceased estate may carry out activities that meet the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) requirements of &apos;carrying on a business?, which entitles the deceased estate to an ABN. </p>

<div>
	<p>In a partnership, the money earned is usually shared among the partners equally. Partners also equally own losses. If a ?formal partnership agreement? or legal agreement is drawn up, earnings and losses must be shared according to what was agreed to. </p>
	<p>In a company structure, the money belongs to the company. There are rules about how money is transferred to directors and shareholders. The money must be kept in a separate bank account and can?t be used for personal expenses. All money flowing in and out of a company must be documented and properly accounted for. </p>

<div>
	<p>Partners keep their share of income earned through the business, but are also personally responsible for all payments, taxes, liabilities and losses. The personal assets of partners can also be used to help pay for any business debts. Partners who have an unequal share of the partnership can have a ?formal partnership agreement? written up to detail the percentage of income paid to each partner as well as the percentage of losses each partner must pay.</p>
	<p>In a company structure, the company pays for all payments, taxes, liabilities and losses. As a director and shareholder your personal assets are separate from the company so can?t be used to pay company debts. In certain cases where directors breach their duties, they may be held personally responsible for company losses.

	<p>The liability of each partner is unlimited. This means all personal assets in your name can be used to pay business debts including if the business is sued. Your home and other assets could potentially be used to pay off the debt, even if the debt was incurred by another partner.</p>

<div>
	<p>As a partner in a partnership, all the money you earn from the partnership is treated as personal income on your individual tax return. All of your income including money earned through your business will be taxed at your individual tax rate. If your total income is $18,200 or less, you don?t pay any tax. This is called the ?tax-free threshold?. Anything above that amount will be taxed according to the amount of money you have earned. Although the partnership must also lodge a tax return, the partnership doesn?t pay tax separately.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re not sure about something to do with your corporate limited partnership, please seek independent legal advice.</p>
<h4>Closely held trust</h4>

An administrator AUSkey gives you full access to manage the registrations attached to an ABN and also allows you to issue additional AUSkeys to business associates.</p><p>Help content:</p><div><h3>Administrator AUSkey</h3>
<div>
<blockquote><hr /><strong>Only Administrator AUSkey</strong> registration is available here. <hr /></blockquote>

<h4>What is an Administrator AUSkey?</h4>
<p>An Administrator AUSkey gives you full access to manage the registrations attached to an ABN and also allows you to issue additional AUSkeys to business associates. An Administrator AUSkey is usually for the director or owner of a business or company.</p>

<blockquote><hr /><p><strong>Important:</strong> An Administrator AUSkey is not for your accountant or tax agent. You can register them for a <a href="https://abr.gov.au/AUSkey/Registering-for-AUSkey/What-type-of-AUSkey-is-right-for-you/" target="_blank">Standard AUSkey</a> on the Australian Business Register (ABR) website.</p><hr /></blockquote>

<h4>New AUSkey</h4>
<p>Select the <strong>New AUSkey</strong> button if you don&apos;t already have an Administrator AUSkey. To register, you need to provide your:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Australian Business Number (ABN)</li>  
<li>Name and role in the organisation</li>
<li>Tax File Number (TFN)</li>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>Australian telephone number </li>
<li>Email address.</li></ul>
<h4>Additional AUSkeys</h4>
<p>Select the <strong>Additional AUSkeys</strong> button if you already have an Administrator AUSkey and you want additional AUSkeys to give to your business associates (who are already listed on your ABN registration).</p><p>To register, you need to login with your AUSkey or MyGov account and provide the following details for each business associate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax File Number (TFN)</li>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>Australian telephone number </li>
<li>Email address.</li></ul>

<p>Be careful who you give this AUSkey to! An administrator AUSkey gives them <strong>full access</strong> to manage the registrations attached to your ABN and also allows them to issue additional AUSkeys to others.</p>
<p>To protect your security, it is also recommended you limit the number of Administrator AUSkeys you create.</p>

<h4>Don&apos;t have a login?</h4>
<p>To apply for additional AUSkey registrations, you&apos;ll need one of the following government logins:</p>
<ul><li><a href="../../auskey/register/new" target="_blank">Administrator AUSkey</a>: You can apply with us for your first Administrator AUSkey.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Business-Portal/Getting-started/Manage-ABN-Connections/" target="_blank">MyGov</a>: Connect your ABN to an existing MyGov account on the MyGov website.</li></ul>

<p>An SMSF allows you to invest in shares, term deposits, managed funds and property as well as collectables such as antiques and artwork.</p>

<p>Self-managed funds can have between one and four members and can be structured as:</p>
<ul>

<li>an <strong>individual trustee</strong> ? where each members is appointed as a trustee, with a minimum of two trustees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trustees are responsible for decisions made about the fund and for complying with super and tax laws. </p>

<blockquote><hr /><strong>Important!</strong> <p>Applying for an ABN doesn&apos;t automatically set up an SMSF. The super fund must already have:</p>
<ul>
<li>at least one appointed trustee </li>

<div>
<h4>Accumulation benefit fund</h4>
<p>Most Australians have their super in an accumulation fund. They are called accumulated funds because the benefits grow or accumulate over time. </p>
<p>This type of fund calculates a benefit to the member based on the total amount of contributions received for the member plus earnings, less expenses and tax.</p>
<h4>Defined benefit funds</h4>
<p>Most defined benefit funds are corporate or public sector funds that are closed to new members. </p>
<p>There are different types of defined benefit funds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defined benefit fund - all members defined benefits</strong>
<p>This means that all members of fund belong to a defined benefit fund. </p></li>
<li><strong>Defined benefit fund - not all members defined benefits</strong>
<p>The fund has at least one defined benefit member, and some or all of the contributions paid into the fund are accumulated on an aggregated basis (they are not made in respect of an individual member). </p></li>
<li><strong>Unfunded defined benefit fund</strong>
<p>In an unfunded defined benefit fund, member benefits are not financed until just before they become payable. The benefits are generally paid by an employer.</p>
<p>These funds mostly cover government employees ? for example the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) and Public Superannuation Scheme (PSS).</p></li>

<li>Non-regulated superannuation fund</li>

<p>Using a superannuation structure means that a business or businesslike activity (such as charitable, leasing or one-off transactions) is held and controlled by an individual or corporate trustee for the benefit of others (the beneficiaries).</p>
<p>A trustee is responsible for everything in the trust, including income and losses, and must report income in a trust income tax return. </p>
<blockquote><hr /> Applying for an ABN does not set up a superannuation fund! The super fund must already have a trust with an appointed trustee.<hr /></blockquote>
<p>It&apos;s best to see a qualified, licensed professional to help you understand what?s involved and the registrations you&apos;ll need.</p>
