
<h3>Have you started your business?</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        If you’re just thinking about starting a partnership, you’re not eligible for an ABN.
    </p>
    <p>To be eligible for an ABN, we expect you to have taken several steps to starting a partnership to show you’re committed, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>meet with financial or business advisors</li>
        <li>write a business plan</li>
        <li>estimate your potential business profit</li>
        <li>apply for finance</li>
        <li>run feasibility studies</li>
        <li>lease or buy premises or equipment for the partnership</li>
        <li>obtain licences to operate</li>
        <li>advertise your partnership.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h3>One-off business deal</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        If you’re making one-off business deals or sales to make a large profit or gain (such as selling property), then you’ll need an ABN.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you expect to make a loss, or a small profit, you don’t need to have an ABN because you won’t need to report it.
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Sell products or services</h3>
<div>
    <p>When we say:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            “sell products or services”, we include renting or leasing out property such as land, cars, boats, copyrights and patents.
        </li>
        <li>
            “regularly”, we mean repeatedly. For example, if you plan to sell your products at market stores every 4 to 6 weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
            “continuously”, we mean non-stop. For example, if you earn a continuous income from renting out farming land to one tenant for the next 20 years.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If your business activity isn’t ongoing or repeated, or you’re not planning to make a profit or gain, what you’re doing could be more of a hobby than a business. Hobbies don’t need ABNs.
