<h3>Have you started your business?</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        If you’re just thinking about starting a business, you’re not eligible for an ABN.
    </p>
    <p>To be eligible for an ABN, we expect you to have taken several steps to starting a business to show you’re committed, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>meet with financial or business advisors</li>
        <li>write a business plan</li>
        <li>estimate your potential business profit</li>
        <li>apply for finance</li>
        <li>run feasibility studies</li>
        <li>lease or buy premises or equipment for the business</li>
        <li>obtain licences to operate</li>
        <li>advertise your business.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>What will your business do?</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        When we say “regularly”, we mean repeatedly in a way that follows a general pattern. There’s no set time period for which you must repeat activities. For example, you’re selling regularly you:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            set up a stall at your local markets every 4 to 6 weeks to sell your products
        </li>
        <li>
            put on exhibitions 3 or 4 times a year to sell your artwork.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When we say “continuously”, we mean non-stop. For example, if you earn a continuous income from renting out farming land to one tenant for the next 20 years.

    </p>
    <p>
        If your business activity isn’t ongoing or repeated, or you’re not planning to make a profit or gain, what you’re doing could be more of a hobby than a business. Hobbies don’t need ABNs.

<h3>Sell products or services</h3>
<div>
    <p>When we say:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            “sell products or services”, we include renting or leasing out property such as land, cars, boats, copyrights and patents.
        </li>
        <li>
            “regularly”, we mean repeatedly. For example, if you plan to sell your products at market stores every 4 to 6 weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
            “continuously”, we mean non-stop. For example, if you earn a continuous income from renting out farming land to one tenant for the next 20 years.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If your business activity isn’t ongoing or repeated, or you’re not planning to make a profit or gain, what you’re doing could be more of a hobby than a business. Hobbies don’t need ABNs.

<h3>One-off business deal</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        If you’re making one-off business deals or sales to make a large profit or gain (such as selling property), then you’ll need an ABN.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you expect to make a loss, or a small profit, you don’t need to have an ABN because you won’t need to report it.
    </p>
